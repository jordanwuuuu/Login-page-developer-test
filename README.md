# DrDoctor Interview Task

This app is written using React and uses Sass for CSS purposes.
I've also installed packages for routing and some icons.

These are:

- `react-router-dom`
- `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`

## How to run the devloper test

1. `npm install` the modules required to run this project
2. `npm run start` to run the app in development mode.

It should automatically open in your localhost, port 3000 (`http://localhost:3000`)

Let me know if you have any issues! 

I will also attach the code in a zip file along with a recording of the app working in case anything goes wrong!

Thanks for Reviewing
